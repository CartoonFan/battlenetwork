Added Chip Summons into the Battle Scene routine. It extends the `ChipUseListener` class and requires a timer so that any buggy summons will gaurantee to end. This routine is new and will undergo a lot of refactoring before it's finished. Great to see it working so well for the first design.

# Features

**Keyboard support for MMBN Chrono X Config .ini files**
[![tool.png](https://s15.postimg.cc/hdqmp92i3/tool.png)](https://postimg.cc/image/wmgk30w6f/)

Just copy and paste your `options.ini` file to the same folder as the executable and the engine will read it. Plug in your controller. You'll know if everything is good because the GamePad icon will show up on the title screen:

There is joystick support but the tricky thing about joysticks are that each vendor has different configurations. If you have a problem with your joystick, file an issue on the project page [here](https://github.com/TheMaverickProgrammer/battlenetwork/issues). 

--------

In this demo, you can choose your Navi, choose which mob to battle, move navi around, shoot, charge, and delete enemies on the grid. When the chip cust is full, you can bring up the chip select menu. 

The player can select chips and deselect them in the order they were added.  Return to battle and you can use the chips by pressing Right-Control. 

At this time only 5 chip types are implemented: All heath+ chips, Invsible, Cannon, CrckPanel, and a few swords.

Rename the file in `resources/database/library.txt - Copy`to `resources/database/library.txt` for a full library while playing the game.

There is 1 Program Advance: XtremeCannon. Can be activated by selecting `Cannon A` + `Cannon B` + `Cannon C` in order. It deals a whopping 600 points of damage, shaking the screen, and attacks the first 3 enemies vertically.
There other other PAs that can be triggered through system but are not implemented and do not do any damage. 
You can write your own PA's and add your own chips by editting the `/database` textfiles.

Mega can also be deleted, ending the demo. If mega wins, the battle results will show up with your time, ranking, and a random chip based on score.

# Controls

SPACE  -> Shoot (hold to charge)
P      -> Pause/Unpause

# Author Pheelbert
Wrote the foundation. He wrote the tile-based movement system emulating an authentic mmbn player experience compared to others out there.
